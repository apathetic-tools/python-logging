# 🧭 Roadmap

Some of these we just want to consider, and may not want to implement.

## 🎯 Core Features


## 🧩 Joiner Scripts (Build System)
Exploring bundling options for generating the single-file release:

- zip file: zipapp / shiv / pyinstaller --onefile


## 🧪 Tests
- should we make lint tests that check for new functions we don't cover?

## 🧑‍💻 Development


## 🚀 Deployment
- Deploy action when I tag a release should create a release and attach it to the tagged release.

## 🔌 API


## 📚 Documentation
- header is not stickied
- the navbar styling was lost when we customized it for the current page
- home is not bolded when on it
- Where do we document the structure of the project? What do we document inside it vs here?
- Logo? Images? Icon? README banner?
- should we generate API docs? replace the ones in our docs?

## 💡 Ideas & Experiments
Potential quality-of-life features:

- publish to PyPI

> See [REJECTED.md](REJECTED.md) for experiments and ideas that were explored but intentionally not pursued.

---

> ✨ *AI was used to help draft language, formatting, and code — plus we just love em dashes.*
