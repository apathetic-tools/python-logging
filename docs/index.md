# Apathetic Python Logging 🪵

**Small quality-of-life features on top of stdlib.**  
*Because you don't need another large dependency.*

*Apathetic Python Logger* provides a lightweight, dependency-free logging solution designed for CLI tools. It extends Python's standard library `logging` module with colorized output, dual-stream handling (stdout/stderr), extra logging levels, and seamless integration with Apathetic Tools projects.

## Features
- 🪶 **Zero dependencies** — Uses only Python's standard library
- 🔄 **Drop-in replacement** — Can be used as a drop-in replacement for stdlib `logging`
- 🐍 **stdlib-compatible** — Uses camelCase naming to match Python's standard library `logging` module
- 🔄 **Dual-stream handling** — Smart routing to stdout/stderr
- 📊 **Extra logging levels** — TEST, TRACE, DETAIL, BRIEF, and SILENT levels for fine-grained control
- 🏷️ **Tag-based formatting** — Clean, readable log tags with emoji support
- 🎨 **Colorized output** — Automatic color detection with TTY support
- 🔧 **CLI-friendly** — Designed with command-line applications in mind
- 🧩 **Apathetic Tools integration** — Works seamlessly with serger and other Apathetic Tools

> [!NOTE]
> This project is largely AI-written and minimally polished. I rely on it, but I haven't reviewed every detail.  
> Expect rough edges. Thoughtful issue reports are appreciated.

## Quick Example

```python
from apathetic_logging import getLogger, registerLogger

# Register your logger
registerLogger("my_app")

# Get the logger instance
logger = getLogger()

# Use it!
logger.info("Hello, world!")
logger.detail("Extra verbosity above INFO")
logger.brief("Lower verbosity than INFO")
logger.trace("Trace information")
```
