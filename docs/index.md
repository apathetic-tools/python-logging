# Apathetic Python Logger 📝

**Minimal wrapper for the Python standard library logger.**  
*Because consistent logging shouldn't require large dependencies.*

*Apathetic Python Logger* provides a lightweight, dependency-free logging solution designed for CLI tools. It extends Python's standard library `logging` module with colorized output, dual-stream handling (stdout/stderr), extra logging levels, and seamless integration with Apathetic Tools projects.

## Features

- 🎨 **Colorized output** — Automatic color detection with TTY support
- 🔄 **Dual-stream handling** — Smart routing to stdout/stderr
- 🪶 **Zero dependencies** — Uses only Python's standard library
- 🏷️ **Tag-based formatting** — Clean, readable log tags with emoji support
- 📊 **Extra logging levels** — TEST, TRACE, DETAIL, MINIMAL, and SILENT levels for fine-grained control
- 🔧 **CLI-friendly** — Designed for command-line applications
- 🧩 **Apathetic Tools integration** — Works seamlessly with serger and other Apathetic Tools

## Quick Example

```python
from apathetic_logging import get_logger, register_logger

# Register your logger
register_logger("my_app")

# Get the logger instance
logger = get_logger()

# Use it!
logger.info("Hello, world!")
logger.detail("Extra verbosity above INFO")
logger.minimal("Lower verbosity than INFO")
logger.trace("Trace information")
```

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+**

No other dependencies required — this library uses only Python's standard library.

## Installation
