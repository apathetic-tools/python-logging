### Git Commit Conventions
- No AI tool attribution or Co-Authored-By trailers
- Format: `type(scope): subject`
- See `.ai/workflows/commit.md` for details

### Checkpoint Commits and Squashing

**Checkpoint format**: `checkpoint(scope): brief description` (intermediate saves during debugging)

**Before regular commit**: Check for checkpoint commits since last regular commit using:
```bash
LAST_REGULAR=$(git log --oneline --format="%H" --grep="checkpoint" --invert-grep -1)
git log --oneline --grep="checkpoint" ${LAST_REGULAR}..HEAD
```
This finds the last commit that is NOT a checkpoint, then checks for checkpoint commits between that and HEAD. If checkpoint commits are found, ask: "I see [N] checkpoint commit(s). Squash with this commit?" and wait for response. If yes, squash via rebase/reset; if no, proceed.
