### Asking Questions

When asking questions, **wait for response** before proceeding. Exception: direct instructions (e.g., "add a function") are confirmation.

### Handling Developer Questions

If developer asks ANY question (including "do we need X?", "can we Y?"), you **must**:
1. Answer completely with recommendations
2. Ask what to do and **stop** - no implementation
3. Wait for response

Exploratory work (reading/searching) is allowed; no code changes.

### Troubleshooting When Stuck

Ask user for insight. Also ask if you should: stash changes, rollback, or add isolated changes one at a time. If yes, create plan in `.plans/` per `.ai/templates/plan_debug_rollback.tmpl.md` and consult `.ai/workflows/plan_debug_rollback.md`.
