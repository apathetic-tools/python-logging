### Asking Questions and Waiting for Responses

- **When asking a question**: If you ask the user a question (e.g., "Should I...?", "Would you like me to...?", "Do you want...?"), you **must pause and wait for their response** before proceeding with any actions related to that question.

- **Do NOT proceed automatically**: After asking a question, do not assume the answer and proceed with the suggested action. Wait for explicit confirmation or direction from the user.

- **Exception**: If the user's query is a direct instruction (e.g., "add a function that...", "fix the bug in..."), you should proceed with the implementation without asking for confirmation, as the instruction itself is the confirmation.

- **Clarifying questions**: When you need clarification to understand the user's request, ask the question and wait for the response before continuing.

### Handling Developer Questions

- **When the developer asks a question**: If the developer asks a question (even if the rest of the prompt implies doing work), you **must**:
  1. Provide a complete answer with recommendations
  2. Ask what to do and **stop** - do not implement changes
  3. Wait for their response before proceeding with any implementation

- **Exploratory work allowed**: You may perform exploratory findings (reading code, searching the codebase, analyzing patterns) to answer the question, but **do not modify core project code** to implement changes.

- **After answering**: Once you've provided the answer and recommendations, ask if you should proceed with implementation. Only proceed after explicit confirmation.
