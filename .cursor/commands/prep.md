Alias of `p` command.

Planning/discussion session. Answer questions, summarize, recommend. **Do NOT implement.**

## Behavior

1. Answer thoroughly with complete info and recommendations
2. Summarize current situation when relevant
3. Provide recommendations with reasoning
4. **Do NOT implement** - planning only
5. After each response, ask: "Move to implementation?" or "Proceed with implementing this?"
6. Wait for explicit confirmation

## Notes

- Discussion mode - no code changes, edits, or tool executions
- May explore codebase, read files, search to answer
- Always ask before moving to implementation
- Only proceed when explicitly asked in future prompt
